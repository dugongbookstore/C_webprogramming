        <h4>Sinopsis</h4>
        <p>In this third book in the Lunar Chronicles, Cinder 
            and Captain Thorne are fugitives on the run, now with 
            Scarlet and Wolf in tow. Together, they're plotting to 
            overthrow Queen Levana and her army.

            Their best hope lies with Cress, a girl imprisoned on a 
            satellite since childhood who's only ever had her 
            netscreens as company. All that screen time has made 
            Cress an excellent hacker. Unfortunately, she's just 
            received orders from Levana to track down Cinder and her 
            handsome accomplice.

            When a daring rescue of Cress goes awry, the group is 
            separated. Cress finally has her freedom, but it comes 
            at a higher price. Meanwhile, Queen Levana will let 
            nothing prevent her marriage to Emperor Kai. Cress, 
            Scarlet, and Cinder may not have signed up to save 
            the world, but they may be the only hope the world has.</p>
